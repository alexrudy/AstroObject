Introduction to :mod:`AstroObject`
==================================

Welcome to AstroObject, a library for managing Astronomical Data. The idea behind this library is to bring Astronomical data and data reduction into the object-oriented age. This library is not meant for use with what astronomers lovingly call "codes", but rather is designed with full fledged programs in mind.

Philosophy
**********

Here be dragons, and philosophers...


Capability
**********

As of |version|, not very much...

Inspiration
***********

This work is heavily inspired by the object oriented approach to Analytic spectra presented in #REFERENCE SOMETHING HERE#

As well, it is inspired by the plethora of "codes" or "scripts" which astronomers write to do data analysis. I have written far too many scripts which were not O-O, and as such, are difficult to port to other applications of the same principle.

Expansion
*********

This module is designed to be expanded by users.
