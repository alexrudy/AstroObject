This program consists of a few simple objects for the repersentation and manipulation of astronomical objects. It allows python programs to interact with FITS files and Raw Data without constantly re-saving such data to the system. It provides a consistent object model, and stores object history for all of your data so that you won't lose data unintentionally.
